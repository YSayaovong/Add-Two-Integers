This repository contains a solution to the LeetCode problem ["Add Two Integers"](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-integers/description/).

## Problem Description

You are given two integers, `num1` and `num2`. The task is to return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

Constraints:
-100 <= num1, num2 <= 100

Approach
This is a straightforward problem that requires adding two integers and returning their sum. We will write a simple function that takes two integer inputs, performs the addition, and returns the result.

### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17

### Example 2:
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
