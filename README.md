# Add Two Integers

This repository contains a solution to the LeetCode problem ["Add Two Integers"](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-integers/description/).

## Problem Description

You are given two integers, `num1` and `num2`. The task is to return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

## Constraints:
-100 <= num1, num2 <= 100
Approach
This is a straightforward problem that requires adding two integers and returning their sum. We will write a simple function that takes two integer inputs, performs the addition, and returns the result.

## Solution
def addTwoIntegers(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    return num1 + num2

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only requires one operation (addition) regardless of the size of the inputs.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is required other than the inputs and the result.
